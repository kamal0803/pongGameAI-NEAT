# pongGameAI-NEAT

Built an AI which teaches itself how to play the game of pong in Python using the pygame module. Each AI was trained with each other based on various paramaters of the NEAT (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. Post training, it was tested against a human player which gave excellent results.
